# Statik

A custom, 0 dependency, static site site generator written in Deno Typescript that uses my own ident based html-like language that is eventually transpiled to proper HTML and served on browser. Nothing serious, just wante my own static website and decided to write the custom DSL alongside to make it somewhat interesting.
